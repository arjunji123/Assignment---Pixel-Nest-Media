Scenario 1: Adding a Leave Tracking Feature

1.Understand the Existing System:

- Study the current HR Management System's code and database structure.
- Understand how employee data and other features are implemented.

2.Plan the Feature:

- Discuss requirements with stakeholders (e.g., HR managers).
- Plan what needs to be done:
           - UI: Design a form for applying for leave (leave type, dates, reason).
           - Back-End API: Create APIs for submitting, approving, and viewing leave requests.
           - Database: Add a new table (leave_applications) with columns like employee_id, leave_type, start_date, end_date, and status.

3.Implementation:

- Front-End:
       - Create a "Leave Application" page with validation for inputs.
- Back-End:
       - Develop APIs to handle leave applications and workflows (e.g., approval, balance tracking).
- Database:
       - Add a table to store leave application details.

4.Testing:

- Test the form, APIs, and database separately.
- Do end-to-end testing to ensure everything works together.

5.Deploy:

- Deploy the feature to a test environment, get feedback, and then release it to production.

Scenario 2: Optimizing a Slow Checkout Page

1.Analyze the Problem:

- Use tools like Chrome DevTools to identify slow areas (e.g., large images, API delays).
- Check API and database response times to find bottlenecks.

2.Optimize Backend:

- Database: Fix slow queries by adding indexes or rewriting them.
- APIs: Simplify logic and reduce unnecessary calls.

3.Optimize Front-End:

- Images and Scripts: Compress images and minify CSS/JavaScript files.
- Lazy Loading: Load less important content (e.g., recommendations) after the main page.

4.Implement Caching:

- Cache frequently accessed data (e.g., cart items) on the server.
- Use browser caching for static files like images, CSS, and JavaScript.

5.Test and Monitor:

- Run load tests to check performance under heavy traffic.
- Use monitoring tools to track improvements after deployment.
