1. JavaScript Code:

function calculateTotal(price, taxRate) {
    const total = price * taxRate;
    return total;
}

console.log(calculateTotal(100, 0.2)); // Expected: 120

--> Problem: The formula price * taxRate only calculates the tax, not the total amount.

--> Fix: Add the tax to the price: const total = price + (price * taxRate);



2. SQL Query: 

SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity) 
FROM orders 
WHERE order_date > CURRENT_DATE - 30 
GROUP BY product_id;

--> Problem: The orders table does not have a product_name column.
             To get product_name, you need to join the orders table with the products table using the product_id column.

--> Fix: Join the orders table with the products table like this:

SELECT p.product_name, SUM(o.quantity) 
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE o.order_date > CURRENT_DATE - 30 
GROUP BY p.product_name;
